# Description

Collection of basic python programs/scripts to try out Machine Learning and Data Science concepts. Do not use in production. The purpose is to do "101" level learning/implementation.

# Contents Overview

- Data analysis with pandas, numpy etc.
- Machine Learning concepts like clustering, naive bayes etc.
- Deep learning concepts/networks simple neuron, CNN, RNN etc.
- Database setup and usage tutorials
- Working with big data tools such as Spark, Hadoop etc.

# Contents

- Data Science
    - Loading data from csv files into Pandas
    - Setting up and running basic queries on MongoDB
    - Setting up and running basic queries on mySQL

- Machine Learning
    - Naive Bayes implementation on numerical data
